<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the changes that Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.3 introduces which may be relevant to partner service tiles.

## <a id="om-credhub"></a> Ops Manager Credentials Stored in CredHub

Ops Manager sends credentials entered by the operator to BOSH CredHub. This change keeps Ops Manager credentials out of the tile manifest. In previous versions of Ops Manager, tile manifests may have indicated credentials with the asterisk character. For example, `****`. Now Ops Manager credentials are indicated in the manifest by a double-parens CredHub link beginning with `/opsmgr/`.

Ops Manager sends new credentials to BOSH CredHub each time the operator clicks **Apply Changes**. When the operator deletes a tile, Ops Manager also removes its credentials from CredHub.

This feature offers greater security for credentials. For more information about where your credentials are stored, see [BOSH CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/credhub/index.html#bosh).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Only operators can make changes to Ops Manager credentials through the Ops Manager UI or API. Any change you attempt to the tile manifest or CredHub is overriden by Ops Manager on the next deploy.</p>


## <a id='secret-text-field'></a> Secret Text Areas

Ops Manager v2.3 supports a text area in its UI that tile authors can mark as `secret`. When a text area is marked as `secret`, the UI shows an `*` when the page is saved, and the API does not return the value entered in this field.

For more information, see the [Custom Forms and Properties](./tile-generator.html#custom-forms) section of the _Tile Generator_ topic.

## <a id="bpm"></a> Introducing BOSH Process Manager

Starting in v2.3, most PAS components use BOSH Process Manager (bpm).  

bpm is a layer between BOSH and the jobs running on PAS component VMs. It improves the way processes run on VMs by providing the following:

* **A well-defined lifecycle**: The introduction of bpm removes a dependency on `monit`. `monit` cannot guarantee job and process start order, and has hidden timeouts that can put a system in an unexpected state. In contrast, bpm clearly defines how it communicates with a process, as well as job length and behavior. 
* **Isolation**: bpm isolates collocated jobs from each other. With the exception of networking, bpm namespaces system resources so a job cannot view or interact with the processes of another job. This provides a security barrier such that if a job on a VM is compromised, the incident is limited to just that job rather than all jobs on the same machine.
* **Resource limiting**: bpm includes resource limiting capability. This prevents any one job from using too many operating system resources and impacting collocated jobs. 

For more information about bpm, see the [bpm-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bpm-release) repository. 

## <a id='cflinuxfs3'></a>Tile Authors Must Manually Migrate Apps to cflinuxfs3

PAS v2.3.0 includes both the cflinuxfs2 and cflinuxfs3 stacks.
Pivotal recommends pushing all apps using the cflinuxfs3 stack for better performance and compatibility with future versions of PAS.

See the following table for more information about compatibility:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>PAS Versions</th>
    <th>Recommended Stack</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PAS v2.3 and later</td>
    <td>cflinuxfs3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PAS v2.2 and earlier</td>
    <td>cflinuxfs2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If your tile contains errands that push apps, such as service brokers, you must manually configure the errands to push apps using the cflinuxfs3 stack.
To maintain compatibility with PAS v2.2, you must also configure the errands to push apps using cflinuxfs2 if the cflinuxfs3 stack is not available.

Errands cannot detect the PAS version.
Configure the errands in your tile to run `cf stacks` to see which stacks are available, and then push the app using the appropriate stack.
