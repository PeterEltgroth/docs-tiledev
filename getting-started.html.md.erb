As a Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Partner, learn the step-by-step process of creating a tile and publishing on Pivotal Network. 

## <a id="tile-def"></a>  What is a Tile?
Tiles are packaged software that can be integrated into PCF.
To provide a service on PCF you must package your software into a tile using Tile Generator.
You can publish tiles on Pivotal Network and install them through Ops Manager.
For more information see, [Tile Generator](./tile-generator.html), and [Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/pcf-interface.html) documentation. 

###Tile Structure
Tiles are zipped directories with a `` .pivotal `` file extension.
Tile directories require three subdirectories: metadata, migrations, and releases.

<table class="nice">
	<tr>
		<th>Directory</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Metadata</td>
		<td> Within this directory, you configure settings for your software in a .yml file. For more information see, <a href= "./product-template-reference.html"> Product Template Reference.</a> </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Migrations</td>
		<td> Within this directory, you track changes across different releases in a .js file. 
			If you are starting a new tile, these files are not relevant. </td>	
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Releases</td>
		<td>Within this directory, you deploy your service source code either as an app or BOSH release. </td>
	</tr>
</table>

## <a id="tile-value"></a> Why Build a Tile?

You want your service to find the audience it deserves. 
You want to join a growing ecosystem that can easily integrate your service. 
You want operators and app developers to interact with your service in an accessible and standardized way. 

If you turn your service into a tile and make it available on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io), then:

* PCF operators can: 
  - Download and install your service as a tile.
  - Configure your service using a UI. 
  - Update your service with a single click.
* PCF developers can:
  - See your service in their PCF services marketplace.
  - Select service plans to subscribe to.
  - Create instances of your service and call them from their apps.
  - Support a continuous and fast development cycle.       

## <a id="partner-days"></a> Partner Days
Partner Days are the single best resource to introduce you to PCF and tile development. During this three day workshop, Pivotal and partner ISV engineers collaborate to prototype and build a complete software integration with PCF. This event will streamline your development process, getting your tile up and running in no time at all!

The workshop is free for all Pivotal partners. If you are not a Pivotal partner yet, you can [sign up for the partner program online right now](https://pivotal.io/partners/programs/tech).

We cannot recommend Partner Days enough! [Learn more and register for an upcoming session](https://pivotal.io/event/partner-days/)!
